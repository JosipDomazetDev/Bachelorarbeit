#2 Prompt:

Development Task: Simple Login Interface

Objective: Create a user interface that allows users to log in with a username and password. The login should always navigate to the next view without validating the credentials.

Requirements:

User Interface:

Design a login page with fields for username and password.
Include a login button that navigates to the next view when clicked.
Functionality:

Input fields accept user input, but no verification is performed.
On clicking the login button, the app navigates directly to the next view.
Expected Outcome:

A functional login page that lets users enter a username and password and proceed to the next view by clicking the login button, with no input validation.



#2 Answer:

To create the simple login interface according to your requirements, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Login Screen:**
   - Inside the `screens/` directory, create a new file called `login_screen.dart`.
   - Design the UI with fields for username and password, and a login button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Login'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Username'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20.0),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20.0),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/productListing');
              },
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

2. **Navigate to Next View:**
   - In the `main.dart` file, set up the routes and navigation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/screens/login_screen.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/screens/product_listing_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Your App Name',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => LoginScreen(),
        '/productListing': (context) => ProductListingScreen(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

With this setup, you have a simple login interface where users can enter their username and password. Upon clicking the login button, the app will navigate directly to the next view (`ProductListingScreen`) without performing any validation of the credentials.

#3 Prompt:

Task: Displaying a List of Products in a ListView

Objective: Implement a feature to display a list of products in a scrollable list view within your Flutter app.

Requirements:

Product List Interface:
Create a screen to display a list of products.

List Item Layout:
Design each list item to show a product image on the left, followed by the product name.
Include an "Add" button at the end of each list item.

Functionality:
Simulate retrieving the product data to populate the list but the list itself is hardcoded.
Use Provider package for state management to handle the product list.

Expected Outcome:
A screen displaying a scrollable list of products, with each item showing a product image, name, and an "Add" button at the end.


#3 Answer:

To implement the feature of displaying a list of products in a scrollable ListView within your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. **Create Product Model:**
   - Define a model class to represent a product. This will typically include properties like id, name, image URL, etc.
   - This should be placed in the `models/` directory.

```dart
class Product {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String imageUrl;

  Product({required this.id, required this.name, required this.imageUrl});
}
```

2. **Mock Product Data:**
   - Create a list of hardcoded product data to simulate retrieving product information.

```dart
List<Product> products = [
  Product(id: 1, name: "Product 1", imageUrl: "url_to_image_1"),
  Product(id: 2, name: "Product 2", imageUrl: "url_to_image_2"),
  // Add more products as needed
];
```

3. **Create Product Listing Screen:**
   - Inside the `screens/` directory, create a new file called `product_listing_screen.dart`.
   - Implement the UI to display the list of products using a ListView.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/models/product.dart';

class ProductListingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Product Listing'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: products.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return _buildProductItem(context, products[index]);
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildProductItem(BuildContext context, Product product) {
    return ListTile(
      leading: Image.network(
        product.imageUrl,
        width: 50,
        height: 50,
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
      ),
      title: Text(product.name),
      trailing: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add functionality to add product to cart
        },
        child: Text('Add'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. **State Management with Provider:**
   - Use the Provider package to manage the state of the product list.
   - Define a provider class to hold the product list and provide it to the UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/models/product.dart';

class ProductProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  List<Product> _products = [];

  List<Product> get products => _products;

  ProductProvider() {
    // Initialize product list here (if required)
    _loadProducts();
  }

  void _loadProducts() {
    // Simulate loading product data
    _products = products; // Use your actual product data here
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

5. **Provide the Product Provider:**
   - In your `main.dart`, provide the `ProductProvider` to the widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/screens/login_screen.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/screens/product_listing_screen.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/providers/product_provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => ProductProvider(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Your App Name',
        initialRoute: '/',
        routes: {
          '/': (context) => LoginScreen(),
          '/productListing': (context) => ProductListingScreen(),
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, when you navigate to the `ProductListingScreen`, you should see a list of products displayed in a scrollable ListView, with each item showing a product image, name, and an "Add" button at the end.
