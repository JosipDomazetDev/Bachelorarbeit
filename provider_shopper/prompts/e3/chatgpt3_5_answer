It looks like the test is expecting to find a widget with the text "Catalog" after tapping the login button ("ENTER"), but it's unable to find it. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The navigation might not be happening correctly after tapping the login button.
2. The text "Catalog" might not be displayed on the next page as expected.
3. There might be a delay in the widget tree update after tapping the login button, causing the test to fail.

To diagnose and fix the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check Navigation**: Ensure that the navigation is set up correctly. After tapping the login button, the app should navigate to the next page where "Catalog" is displayed.

2. **Verify Text Display**: Make sure that the text "Catalog" is indeed displayed on the next page. You can manually verify this in the application to confirm.

3. **Delay in Widget Tree Update**: If there's a delay in the widget tree update after tapping the login button, you might need to pump some additional frames using `tester.pump()` to allow the UI to update before verifying the presence of the "Catalog" text.

Here's an updated version of the test with additional pumping after tapping the login button:

```dart
testWidgets('Login page Widget test', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MultiProvider(
    providers: [
      Provider(create: (context) => CatalogModel()),
      ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<CatalogModel, CartModel>(
        create: (context) => CartModel(),
        update: (context, catalog, cart) {
          cart!.catalog = catalog;
          return cart;
        },
      ),
    ],
    child: MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: router()),
  ));

  // Tap the login button
  await tester.tap(find.text('ENTER'));

  // Pump some frames to allow UI to update
  await tester.pump();

  // Verify the presence of "Catalog" text
  expect(find.text('Catalog'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

Try running the test again with these adjustments and see if it resolves the issue. If not, you may need to further investigate the navigation and widget rendering in your application.
