The problem lies in the way the test verifies navigation. Here's how to fix it:

**Explanation of the Error:**

The error message "Expected: exactly one matching candidate, Actual: _TextWidgetFinder:<Found 0 widgets with text "Catalog": []>"  indicates that the test expects to find a widget with the text "Catalog" after pressing the login button. However, the test doesn't find any such widget.

**Fixing the Test:**

There are two main approaches to fix this test:

1.  **Stubbing the Next Page:**

  This approach involves creating a mock widget for the next page (presumably the Catalog page). This mock widget wouldn't have the full functionality but would simply exist with the text "Catalog". This allows the test to verify navigation without needing the entire next page to be loaded.

   Here's an example using `MockNavigatorObserver` to achieve this:

   ```dart
   testWidgets('Login page Widget test', (tester) async {
     final navigatorObserver = MockNavigatorObserver();

     await tester.pumpWidget(
       MaterialApp.router(
         routerConfig: router(),
         navigatorObservers: [navigatorObserver],
       ),
     );

     await tester.tap(find.text('ENTER'));

     // Verify navigation by checking pushed route
     expect(navigatorObserver.pushed.single.widget, isA<MockCatalogPage>());
   });

   class MockNavigatorObserver extends NavigatorObserver {
     final List<PageRoute> pushed = [];

     @override
     void didPush(Route<dynamic> route, Route<dynamic>? previousRoute) {
       super.didPush(route, previousRoute);
       pushed.add(route);
     }
   }

   class MockCatalogPage extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Text('Catalog');
     }
   }
   ```

2.  **Using a Navigation Testing Package:**

  You can utilize a package like `flutter_test` or `provider_test` which offer functionalities to test navigation. These packages provide features like mocking navigators and asserting that specific routes are pushed after an action.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

- If the next page is simple and doesn't have complex logic involved, stubbing it might be a good choice.
- If the next page has its own logic and interactions you might want to test, consider using a navigation testing package for a more comprehensive test.

**Important Note:**

Remember to update your `router()` function to actually push the Catalog page when the login button is pressed. This code snippet only focuses on the testing aspect.
