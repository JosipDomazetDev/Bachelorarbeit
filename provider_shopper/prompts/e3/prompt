You are a Flutter developer tasked with fixing bugs in an offline e-commerce application.

Problem: The Unit-Test for navigating from the login page to the next page is failing. Pressing the login button should be enough.

Error:
"""
The following TestFailure was thrown running a test:
Expected: exactly one matching candidate
Actual: _TextWidgetFinder:<Found 0 widgets with text "Catalog": []>
Which: means none were found but one was expected
"""

Code:
"""
testWidgets('Login page Widget test', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MultiProvider(
    providers: [
      Provider(create: (context) => CatalogModel()),
      ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<CatalogModel, CartModel>(
        create: (context) => CartModel(),
        update: (context, catalog, cart) {
          cart!.catalog = catalog;
          return cart;
        },

    ],
    child: MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: router()),
  ));
  // Verifying the behaviour of ENTER button.
  await tester.tap(find.text('ENTER'));
  expect(find.text('Catalog'), findsOneWidget);
