## Prompt #1: Initial Setup
You are taking on the role of a Flutter developer tasked with creating an offline e-commerce application from scratch. This prompt will lay the groundwork for the project, focusing on the overall structure and key components.

### Project Overview
The aim is to develop a Flutter-based e-commerce app. This prompt provides a general overview of the appâ€™s structure and main functionalities to set the context for detailed development in subsequent interactions.

### Overview of Key Components
- **User Authentication:** Implement a basic login interface with username and password fields.
- **Product Listing Interface:** Create a scrollable list view that will display products. The list of products is hardcoded.
- **Shopping Cart Functionalities:** Allow users to interact with the shopping cart, adding and removing products as needed.

### Technical Framework
- **State Management:** The app will utilize the Provider package to ensure modularity and testability.
- **Testing:** The structure will be designed to facilitate straightforward unit testing for all components.
- **Code Quality:** The development will adhere to the latest Flutter best practices.

### Objective
The goal of this prompt is to establish a solid foundational understanding and prepare for detailed feature development.

#### Cart Button
Place a cart button at the end of the AppBar in the product list view.

#### Functionality

##### Opening the Cart
Implement functionality so that clicking the cart button opens the cart view.

#### Expected Outcome
The AppBar in the product list view should contain a header title at the top and a cart button at the end. Clicking the cart button should open the cart view.

## Prompt #6: Implementing the Shopping Cart View
Objective: Create a view in your Flutter app to display the products added to the shopping cart. Each product should be shown with an icon and product name on the left, and a "Remove" button with an icon at the end of the row.
