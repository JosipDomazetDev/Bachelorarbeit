The error message "Vertical viewport was given unbounded height" typically occurs when a widget tries to render a scrollable view without any constraints on its height. In your case, it seems to be coming from the ListView in your _CartList widget. To fix this, you need to wrap your ListView with a container and provide it with a fixed height or use another widget that constrains its height.

Here's the modified version of your _CartList widget with a fixed height Container:

```dart
class _CartList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var itemNameStyle = Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge;
    var cart = context.watch<CartModel>();

    return Container(
      height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.6, // Adjust the height as needed
      child: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: cart.items.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(
          leading: const Icon(Icons.done),
          trailing: IconButton(
            icon: const Icon(Icons.remove_circle_outline),
            onPressed: () {
              cart.remove(cart.items[index]);
            },
          ),
          title: Text(
            cart.items[index].name,
            style: itemNameStyle,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace the height value (`MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.6`) with a suitable fixed height or use a different method to constrain the height according to your UI requirements. This will prevent the "unbounded height" error and ensure that your ListView is rendered correctly within its parent container.
