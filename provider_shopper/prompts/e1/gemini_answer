The code you provided has a potential overflow issue with long product names because the `Text` widget is wrapped inside an `Expanded` widget. Let's explore some ways to fix this:

**1. Using TextOverflow.ellipsis:**

This is the simplest solution. You can modify the `Text` widget to use the `TextOverflow.ellipsis` property. This will cause the text to be truncated with an ellipsis (...) if it overflows the available space.

```dart
Expanded(
  child: Text(
    item.name,
    style: textTheme,
    overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
  ),
),
```

**2. Limiting Text Length:**

If you want more control over the text length, you can use the `Text` widget's `maxLines` property. This will limit the number of lines displayed and automatically add an ellipsis if the text overflows.

```dart
Expanded(
  child: Text(
    item.name,
    style: textTheme,
    maxLines: 2, // Adjust maxLines as needed
  ),
),
```

**3. Using Flexible instead of Expanded:**

Instead of `Expanded`, you can use the `Flexible` widget. Unlike `Expanded`, `Flexible` takes a `flex` property that allows you to specify how much space the widget should occupy relative to other `Flexible` widgets within the same row. This gives you more control over the text's allocated space.

```dart
Flexible(
  flex: 3, // Adjust flex value as needed
  child: Text(
    item.name,
    style: textTheme,
    overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
  ),
),
```

**Choosing the right solution:**

* Use `TextOverflow.ellipsis` for a simple solution where truncation is acceptable.
* Use `maxLines` if you want to control the exact number of lines displayed.
* Use `Flexible` for more control over the text's allocated space within the row.

By implementing one of these solutions, you can ensure that long product names are displayed properly without overflowing the available space in your Flutter application.
