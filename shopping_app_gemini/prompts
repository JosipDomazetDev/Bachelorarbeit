#1 Answer:

This is a great start for building your offline e-commerce app with Flutter! Here's a breakdown of the key components you mentioned:

**User Interface (UI):**

* **Login Screen:** This screen will have a simple design with username and password fields. Upon successful login, it should redirect the user to the product listing.
* **Product Listing View:** This view will display a scrollable list of products. Each product item can showcase details like image, name, price, etc.
* **Shopping Cart:** Implement a dedicated shopping cart screen where users can view the added items, modify quantities (optional), and potentially see the total amount (though actual payment processing won't be available in offline mode).

**Functionality:**

* **User Authentication:** This is a basic implementation to restrict access to the product listing. You can explore options like storing login credentials securely using local storage solutions provided by Flutter packages.
* **Product Data:** Since this is offline, you'll need to hardcode product details like name, description, price, and image assets within the app.
* **Shopping Cart Management:** Users should be able to add and remove products from the cart. Consider using a state management solution like Provider to track the cart items and update the view dynamically.

**Technical Choices:**

* **Provider:** This is a good choice for state management as it promotes modularity and simplifies testing.
* **Unit Testing:**  Designing the code with unit testing in mind will ensure the app functions correctly as you add features. Utilize Flutter's testing framework (Flutter Driver) to write unit tests for various components.
* **Code Quality:** Following Flutter best practices will make your codebase clean, maintainable, and easier to scale for future additions.  Refer to official Flutter documentation for guidance on code style and best practices.

**Next Steps:**

This initial setup provides a solid foundation.  Future prompts can delve deeper into specific details like:

* Advanced Login options (e.g., secure storage)
* Implementing detailed product data structures
* Shopping cart functionalities (quantity management, subtotal calculation)
* User Interface design for each screen

By iteratively building upon these core functionalities, you'll have a functional offline e-commerce app built with Flutter!

#2 Prompt:

Development Task: Simple Login Interface

Objective: Create a user interface that allows users to log in with a username and password. The login should always navigate to the next view without validating the credentials.

Requirements:

User Interface:

Design a login page with fields for username and password.
Include a login button that navigates to the next view when clicked.
Functionality:

Input fields accept user input, but no verification is performed.
On clicking the login button, the app navigates directly to the next view.
Expected Outcome:

A functional login page that lets users enter a username and password and proceed to the next view by clicking the login button, with no input validation.


#2 Answer:

## Building the Simple Login Interface in Flutter

Here's how you can create the login interface for your offline e-commerce app in Flutter:

**1. Setting Up the Login Screen:**

* Create a new Dart file named `login_screen.dart`.
* Import necessary packages like `flutter` and `package:flutter/material.dart`.

**2. Building the UI:**

* Define a class named `LoginPage` that extends `StatelessWidget`.
* In the `build` method, create a `Scaffold` widget to structure the login screen.
* Inside the `body` property of `Scaffold`, use a `Center` widget to center the login form.
* Within the `Center`, utilize a `Column` widget to stack the UI elements vertically.

**3. Username and Password Fields:**

* Add two `TextField` widgets within the `Column` to capture username and password.
* Set appropriate labels (e.g., "Username", "Password") for each `TextField`.
* For the password field, set the `obscureText` property to `true` to hide characters as the user types.

**4. Login Button:**

* Add an `ElevatedButton` widget below the password field.
* Set the button's `onPressed` property to a function that handles the login action (we'll define this later).
* Label the button with "Login".

**5. Navigation on Login:**

* Define an `onPressed` function for the `ElevatedButton`.
* Inside this function, use the `Navigator.push` method to navigate to the next view.
* Since you don't want validation, you can directly push the next view (replace `NextView` with the actual class name for your next screen).

Here's the complete code for `login_screen.dart`:

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Login'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Username',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16.0),
            TextField(
              obscureText: true,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Password',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16.0),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextView()));
              },
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Replace 'NextView' with the actual class name for your next screen
class NextView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Next View'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('You have successfully logged in!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Remember:** This is a basic login screen without validation. In future iterations, you can implement functionalities to:

* Store login credentials securely.
* Validate username and password against pre-defined values or a database (if you plan to add online functionality later).

#3 Prompt:
Task: Displaying a List of Products in a ListView

Objective: Implement a feature to display a list of products in a scrollable list view within your Flutter app.

Requirements:

Product List Interface:
Create a screen to display a list of products.

List Item Layout:
Design each list item to show a product image on the left, followed by the product name.
Include an "Add" button at the end of each list item.

Functionality:
Simulate retrieving the product data to populate the list but the list itself is hardcoded.
Use Provider package for state management to handle the product list.

Expected Outcome:
A screen displaying a scrollable list of products, with each item showing a product image, name, and an "Add" button at the end.

#3 Answer:
## Building Product Listing with Provider and ListView

Here's how to implement a product list view with Provider for state management:

**1. Setting Up the Product Model:**

* Create a new Dart file named `product_model.dart`.
* Define a class named `Product` with properties like `id` (for uniqueness), `imageUrl`, `name`, and potentially `price` (if needed).

**2. Creating the Product Provider:**

* Create a new Dart file named `product_provider.dart`.
* Import necessary packages including `provider`.
* Define a class named `ProductListProvider` extending `ChangeNotifier`.
* Inside `ProductListProvider`, create a private list variable to hold the product data (`List<Product>`).
* Implement methods to:
    * Add a product to the list (`addProduct(Product product)`)
    * Notify listeners when the list changes (`notifyListeners()` after adding a product).
* Define a static instance of `ProductListProvider` accessible throughout the app (e.g., using a getter).

**3. Building the Product List Screen:**

* Create a new Dart file named `product_list_screen.dart`.
* Import necessary packages and `ProductListProvider`.
* Define a stateful widget class named `ProductListScreen`.
* Inside `ProductListScreen`, use `Consumer` widget from Provider to access the `ProductListProvider` instance.

**4. Building the ListView:**

* In the `build` method of `ProductListScreen`, use a `Scaffold` widget.
* Within the body, access the product list from the provider using `Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context).productList`.
* Utilize a `ListView.builder` widget to iterate through the product list.

**5. Designing the List Item:**

* Inside the `itemBuilder` function of `ListView.builder`, return a widget representing each list item (e.g., `ListTile`).
* Use a `Row` widget to structure the list item layout:
    * Display the product image using `Image.asset` widget.
    * Display the product name using a `Text` widget.
    * Add an `IconButton` with an "Add" icon at the end of the row.

**Here's an example code breakdown (replace with your actual image paths):**

**product_model.dart:**

```Dart
class Product {
  final int id;
  final String imageUrl;
  final String name;
  final double price; // Optional, add if needed

  Product({
    required this.id,
    required this.imageUrl,
    required this.name,
    this.price = 0.0, // Set default price if not provided
  });
}
```

**product_provider.dart:**

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class ProductListProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final List<Product> _productList = [
    Product(id: 1, imageUrl: 'assets/images/product1.jpg', name: 'Product 1'),
    Product(id: 2, imageUrl: 'assets/images/product2.jpg', name: 'Product 2'),
    // Add more products to the list
  ];

  List<Product> get productList => _productList;

  void addProduct(Product product) {
    _productList.add(product);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  static final ProductListProvider instance = ProductListProvider();
}
```

**product_list_screen.dart:**

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'product_model.dart';
import 'product_provider.dart';

class ProductListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProductListScreenState createState() => _ProductListScreenState();
}

class _ProductListScreenState extends State<ProductListScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final productList = Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context).productList;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Product List'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: productList.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final product = productList[index];
          return ListTile(
            leading: Image.asset(product.imageUrl),
            title: Text(product.name),
            trailing: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.add),
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate adding to cart (can be extended later)
                print('Adding product ${product.name} to cart');
              },
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }

#4 Prompt:
Task: Adding Products to the Shopping Cart

Objective: Enable users to add products to the shopping cart by clicking the "Add" button associated with each product in your Flutter app.

Requirements:

Adding Products:

Implement functionality so that clicking the "Add" button adds the corresponding product to the shopping cart.

Updating UI:
After adding a product to the cart, replace the "Add" button with an icon to signify successful addition.

Functionality:
Ensure that the shopping cart is updated with the added product.
Update the UI dynamically to reflect changes after adding a product.
Manage the state of the shopping cart using the Provider package.

Expected Outcome:
Users should be able to add products to the shopping cart by clicking the "Add" button associated with each product. After successful addition, the "Add" button should be replaced with an icon indicating that the product has been added to the cart.

#4 Answer:
## Implementing Shopping Cart Functionality with Provider

Here's how to enhance the product list with shopping cart functionality using Provider:

**1. Modifying the Product Model (Optional):**

* In `product_model.dart`, consider adding a boolean flag named `isAdded` to track if a product is already in the cart.

**2. Updating the Product Provider:**

* In `product_provider.dart`, modify the `addProduct` method:
    * Check if the product already exists in the cart using `productList.contains(product)`.
    * If not present, add the product and set `isAdded` to `true` (if you added the flag).
    * Notify listeners after adding the product.

**3. Updating the Product List UI:**

* In `product_list_screen.dart`, modify the `itemBuilder` function of `ListView.builder`:
    * Access the `isAdded` flag from the product (if you added it).
    * Conditionally display the "Add" button or a checkmark icon (or any indicator) based on the `isAdded` value.

**4. Handling Button Click:**

* Update the `onPressed` function of the `IconButton` in the list item:
    * Use the `ProductListProvider` to call the `addProduct` method, passing the corresponding product.

**Here's the updated code breakdown:**

**product_model.dart (Optional Change):**

```Dart
class Product {
  // ... existing properties

  bool isAdded = false; // Optional flag to track addition to cart

  // ... existing constructor
}
```

**product_provider.dart:**

```Dart
void addProduct(Product product) {
  if (!productList.contains(product)) {
    product.isAdded = true; // Set flag if added (optional)
    _productList.add(product);
  }
  notifyListeners();
}
```

**product_list_screen.dart:**

```Dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // ... existing code

  return Scaffold(
    // ...

    body: ListView.builder(
      // ...

      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final product = productList[index];
        return ListTile(
          leading: Image.asset(product.imageUrl),
          title: Text(product.name),
          trailing: IconButton(
            icon: product.isAdded ? Icon(Icons.check) : Icon(Icons.add), // Conditionally display icon
            onPressed: () {
              Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context, listen: false)
                  .addProduct(product);
            },
          ),
        );
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We use the `isAdded` flag (if added) to conditionally display the "Add" button or a checkmark icon.
* Clicking the button calls `addProduct` from the provider, which checks for existing items and updates the product list and `isAdded` flag accordingly.
* `Provider.of(context, listen: false)` ensures the widget doesn't rebuild unnecessarily when the cart isn't actively used in the list item UI.

**Remember:** This is a basic implementation. You can extend it to:

* Display the number of items in the cart.
* Implement a dedicated shopping cart screen to view added items and potentially manage quantities.

#5 Prompt:

Task: Adding Header Title and Cart Button to the AppBar in the Product List View

Objective: Enhance the product list view in your Flutter app by adding a header title in the AppBar and a cart button at the end of the AppBar.

Requirements:

Header Title:
Display a title/header at the top of the AppBar in the product list view.

Cart Button:
Place a cart button at the end of the AppBar in the product list view.

Functionality:

Opening the Cart:
Implement functionality so that clicking the cart button opens the cart view.

Expected Outcome:
The AppBar in the product list view should contain a header title at the top and a cart button at the end.
Clicking the cart button should open the cart view.

#5 Answer:

## Enhancing the AppBar with Title and Cart Button

Here's how to modify the product list view's AppBar to include a title and a cart button:

**1. Modifying the Product List Screen:**

* In `product_list_screen.dart`, update the `AppBar` widget within the `Scaffold`.

**2. Adding the Title:**

* Set the `title` property of the `AppBar` to a `Text` widget displaying the desired title (e.g., "Products").

**3. Implementing the Cart Button:**

* Use the `actions` property of the `AppBar` to add a list of widgets.
* Within the `actions` list, add an `IconButton` widget.
* Set the `icon` property of the `IconButton` to an icon representing the cart (e.g., `Icon(Icons.shopping_cart)`).

**4. Opening the Cart View:**

* Define the `onPressed` function for the `IconButton`.
* Inside the function, use `Navigator.push` to navigate to the cart view.
* Replace `"CartView"` with the actual class name for your cart screen (if you haven't created it yet).

**Here's the updated code snippet for the AppBar:**

```Dart
AppBar(
  title: Text('Products'),
  actions: [
    IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.shopping_cart),
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => CartView()));
      },
    ),
  ],
),
```

**Note:** This creates a basic cart button that navigates to a placeholder "CartView". You'll need to implement the cart view functionality later, which might involve displaying the added items and potentially managing quantities.

#6 Prompt:

Task: Implementing the Shopping Cart View

Objective: Create a view in your Flutter app to display the products added to the shopping cart. Each product should be shown with an icon and product name on the left, and a "Remove" button with an icon at the end of the row.

Requirements:

Shopping Cart View:

Develop a new screen to show the products added to the shopping cart.
Display each product with an icon and product name on the left side of the row.
Include a "Remove" button with an icon at the end of each row to allow users to remove products from the cart.

Back Button:
Add a "Back" button to the AppBar of the shopping cart view, enabling users to return to the overall product view.
Functionality:

Removing Products:
Implement functionality so that clicking the "Remove" button removes the corresponding product from the shopping cart.

Expected Outcome:
The shopping cart view should display all the products added to the cart, with each product showing an icon, name, and a "Remove" button.
Clicking the "Remove" button should remove the respective product from the cart.
The AppBar in the shopping cart view should include a "Back" button allowing users to return to the overall product view.

#6 Answer:

Here's how to implement the shopping cart view with product display, removal functionality, and a back button:

**1. Creating the Shopping Cart Screen:**

* Create a new Dart file named `cart_view.dart`.
* Import necessary packages and `ProductListProvider`.

**2. Building the Cart View UI:**

* Define a stateful widget class named `CartView`.
* Inside the `build` method, use a `Scaffold` widget.

**3. Adding Back Button:**

* Set the `appBar` property of the `Scaffold` to an `AppBar` widget.
* Within the `AppBar`, use the `leading` property to add an `IconButton` with an "arrow back" icon (`Icon(Icons.arrow_back)`) that navigates back to the product list view using `Navigator.pop(context)`.

**4. Checking for Empty Cart:**

* Access the product list from the `ProductListProvider` using `Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context).productList`.
* Before building the cart items list, check if the list is empty.
* If empty, display a message indicating "No items in the cart".

**5. Building the Cart Items List:**

* If the cart has items, use a `ListView.builder` widget to iterate through the product list.
* Inside the `itemBuilder` function, create a widget representing each cart item (e.g., `ListTile`).

**6. Displaying Product Details:**

* Use a `Row` widget to structure the cart item layout:
    * Display the product image using `Image.asset`.
    * Display the product name using a `Text` widget.

**7. Adding Remove Button:**

* Add an `IconButton` with a "remove" icon (`Icon(Icons.remove)`) at the end of the row.

**8. Handling Remove Button Click:**

* Set the `onPressed` function for the `IconButton`.
* Inside the function, use the `ProductListProvider` to remove the corresponding product from the cart.
* You can achieve this by filtering the product list to exclude the one being removed and updating the provider's list.
* Notify listeners after removing the product.

**Here's the code breakdown for `cart_view.dart`:**

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'product_model.dart';
import 'product_provider.dart';

class CartView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final productList = Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context).productList;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Shopping Cart'),
        leading: IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
          onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
        ),
      ),
      body: productList.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: Text('No items in the cart'))
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: productList.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final product = productList[index];
                return ListTile(
                  leading: Image.asset(product.imageUrl),
                  title: Text(product.name),
                  trailing: IconButton(
                    icon: Icon(Icons.remove),
                    onPressed: () {
                      final provider = Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context, listen: false);
                      provider.productList.removeWhere((p) => p.id == product.id);
                      provider.notifyListeners();
                    },
                  ),
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We check if the cart is empty and display a message if there are no items.
* The `IconButton` for removing a product utilizes `Provider.of` with `listen: false` to avoid unnecessary rebuilds when the cart view doesn't actively use the entire product list.
* We filter the product list in the provider to remove the selected item and notify listeners about the change.

**Remember:** This is a basic implementation. You can extend it to:

* Display the total price of the cart items (if you have price information in the product model).
* Implement a "Clear Cart" button to remove all items at once.

#7 Prompt:

Task: Displaying Total Price and Buy Button in the Shopping Cart View

Objective: Enhance the shopping cart view in your Flutter app by displaying the total price of all products below the product list, along with a "Buy" button.

Requirements:

Total Price and Buy Button:
Show the total price of all products below the product list in the shopping cart view.
Include a "Buy" button below the total price.

Snackbar Display:
Upon clicking the "Buy" button, display a snackbar with the message "Purchased".

Functionality:

Buy Button Action:
Implement functionality so that clicking the "Buy" button displays a snackbar confirming the purchase.

Expected Outcome:
The shopping cart view should display the total price of all products below the product list, along with a "Buy" button.
Clicking the "Buy" button should trigger a snackbar with the message "Purchased".

#7 Answer:

Here's how to add total price and a "Buy" button with snackbar functionality to the shopping cart view:

**1. Calculating Total Price:**

* In `cart_view.dart`, define a function to calculate the total price:

```Dart
double calculateTotalPrice(List<Product> products) {
  double totalPrice = 0.0;
  for (var product in products) {
    totalPrice += product.price; // Assuming price exists in the product model
  }
  return totalPrice;
}
```

**2. Updating the Cart View UI:**

* Modify the `build` method of `CartView` to display the total price and "Buy" button.
* After the `ListView.builder`, add a `Container` with padding to create a section for the total price.

**3. Displaying Total Price:**

* Inside the `Container`, use a `Row` widget:
    * Display a text label (e.g., "Total Price:") using a `Text` widget.
    * Display the calculated total price using a `Text` widget, formatting it appropriately (e.g., using `NumberFormat`).

**4. Adding Buy Button:**

* Below the total price display, add an `ElevatedButton` widget with the label "Buy".

**5. Handling Buy Button Click:**

* Set the `onPressed` function for the `ElevatedButton`.
* Inside the function, display a snackbar using `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar`.
* Set the snackbar content to a `SnackBar` widget with the text "Purchased".

**Here's the updated code snippet for `cart_view.dart`:**

```Dart
double calculateTotalPrice(List<Product> products) {
  // ... existing code to calculate total price
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final productList = Provider.of<ProductListProvider>(context).productList;

  // ... existing code for cart items list

  return Scaffold(
    // ...

    body: productList.isEmpty
        ? Center(child: Text('No items in the cart'))
        : ListView.builder(
            // ... existing code for cart items list

          ),
    bottomNavigationBar: Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
        children: [
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
            children: [
              Text('Total Price:'),
              Text(
                NumberFormat.currency(symbol: '\$').format(calculateTotalPrice(productList)),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 8.0),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(
                  content: Text('Purchased'),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Buy'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We define a function to calculate the total price iterating through the product list and assuming a `price` property exists in the product model.
* The cart view's UI is modified to display the total price and "Buy" button below the product list.
* Clicking the "Buy" button triggers a snackbar with the message "Purchased" using `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar`.

**Note:** This is a simplified implementation. In a real scenario, you might want to:

* Implement actual payment processing logic instead of just a snackbar confirmation.
* Consider adding functionalities like quantity management for each product in the cart before purchase.

#T8 Prompt:

Task: Writing Unit Tests for User Authentication

Objective: Develop unit tests to ensure that users can log in with a username and password, and that successful login always navigates to the next view without logic verification.

Requirements:

Test Scenarios:

Write unit tests to verify that users can successfully log in with valid username and password combinations.
Ensure that the login process navigates to the next view without performing logic verification.

Navigation Testing:
Verify that navigation to the next view occurs after successful login, without any logic verification checks.

Expected Outcome:
Unit tests should confirm that users can log in with valid credentials and navigate to the next view.

#T8 Answer:

## Unit Testing User Authentication (without Logic Verification)

Here's how you can write unit tests for user authentication in your Flutter app, focusing on successful login navigation without logic verification:

**1. Setting Up Test Environment:**

* Create a new test directory within your project (e.g., `test`).
* Inside the test directory, create a Dart file named `login_test.dart`.
* Import necessary packages like `flutter_test` and your login logic file (e.g., `login_page.dart`).

**2. Mocking the Navigator:**

* Since we're testing navigation, we need to mock the `Navigator.push` functionality.
* Use the `mockito` package to create a mock class for `Navigator`.

**3. Writing the Login Test:**

* Define a test function with `test` from `flutter_test`.
* Inside the test function:
    * Create a mock `Navigator` object using `MockNavigator()`.
    * Create a test instance of your login page class (e.g., `LoginPage`).
    * Simulate user input by setting the username and password fields within the login page.
    * Trigger the login button's `onPressed` function.

**4. Verifying Navigation:**

* Use `verify` from `mockito` to assert that `Navigator.push` was called with the correct arguments (the next view class).
* You're essentially verifying that the login process triggers navigation without checking the validity of credentials (as per the requirement).

**Here's an example breakdown for `login_test.dart`:**

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'login_page.dart'; // Replace with your login page file

class MockNavigator extends Mock implements Navigator {}

void main() {
  group('LoginPage Test', () {
    test('navigates to next view on successful login', () {
      final mockNavigator = MockNavigator();

      final loginPage = LoginPage();

      // Simulate user input (replace with actual methods for setting username/password)
      loginPage.usernameController.text = 'test_user';
      loginPage.passwordController.text = 'test_password';

      loginPage.onPressed();

      verify(mockNavigator.push(
        any,
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextView()), // Replace 'NextView' with your next view class
      ));
    });
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We mock the `Navigator` to isolate the login logic's navigation behavior.
* The test simulates user input by setting the username and password fields directly (replace this with actual methods in your login page to set these values).
* We verify that `Navigator.push` is called with the expected arguments, which is navigating to the next view class, confirming successful login navigation without logic verification.

**Remember:**

* This is a basic example. You can expand the test suite to cover various scenarios like empty fields or invalid credentials (depending on your implementation).
* For more robust testing, consider using a dedicated mocking framework like `mockito` instead of directly mocking the `Navigator` class.
